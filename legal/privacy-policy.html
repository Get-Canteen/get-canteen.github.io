                <p>We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:</p>
                <p><em>Registration.</em> To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email
                    address, and a password.</p>
                <p><em>Profile.</em> You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your title,
                    description, interests, photo, list of offerings/requests, and availability. You don’t have to
                    provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more
                    from our Services, including helping business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to
                    include this information on your profile. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile
                    that you would not want to be publicly available.</p>
                <p><em>Content you submit.</em> We collect the content you submit to the Services. This includes your
                    posts and comments including your messages with other users (e.g., chats). Your content may include
                    text, links, images, gifs, and videos. You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you
                    don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services.</p>
                <p><em>Actions you take.</em> We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services.
                    This includes your interactions with content, such as liking. It also includes your interactions
                    with other users, such as sending requests. We collect your interactions with groups, like when you
                    join a group.</p>
                <p><em>Other information.</em> You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example,
                    we may collect information when you fill out a form, request customer support or otherwise
                    communicate with us.</p>

                    include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device
                    information (e.g., device IDs), pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, hardware settings,
                    and search terms.</p>
                <p><em>Location information.</em> We may receive and process information about your location. For

                    device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). We may also receive location information from you
                    when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content

                <p>When you use the Services, certain information may be shared with other users and the public. For

                <ul>
                    <li>When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities

                    <li>When you submit content (such as a post or comment) to a public group within the Services, any

                        the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Some parts of the
                        Services may be private, such as private groups. When you submit content to private groups, only
                        other users within the private groups will be able to see that content.</li>
                    <li>When you send private messages, the recipients of those messages will be able to see the content
                        of your message, your name, and the date and time the message was sent.</li>

                <p>Otherwise, we do not share, sell, or give away your personal information to third parties unless one
                    of the following circumstances applies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>To comply with the law.</em> We may share information in response to a request for

                        regulation, legal process or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting
                        national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will
                        attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such
                        a request.</li>
                    <li><em>In an emergency.</em> We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent

                    <li><em>To enforce our policies and rights.</em> We may share information if we believe your actions
                        are
                        inconsistent with our user agreements, rules, or other Canteen policies, or to protect the
                        rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.</li>
                    <li><em>With your consent.</em> We may share information about you with your consent or at your

                        been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For
